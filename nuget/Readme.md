## Configuration

Before using the news API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com?utm_source=nuget&utm_medium=readme)

---

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started quickly:

```csharp
using System;
using APIVerve.API.WorldNews;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize the API client
        var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

        var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

        // Make the API call
        try
        {
            var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);

            if (response.Error != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"API Error: {response.Error}");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Success!");
                // Access response data using the strongly-typed ResponseObj properties
                Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

The WorldNews API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/news](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/news?utm_source=nuget&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

###### Authentication
WorldNews API uses API Key-based authentication. When you create an instance of the API client, you can pass your API Key as a parameter.

```csharp
// Create an instance of the API client
var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Async/Await Pattern - Recommended)

The modern async/await pattern provides the best performance and code readability:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using APIVerve.API.WorldNews;

public class Example
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

        var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

        var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);

        if (response.Error != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: {response.Error}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
        }
    }
}
```

### Synchronous Usage

If you need to use synchronous code, you can use the `Execute` method:

```csharp
using System;
using APIVerve.API.WorldNews;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

        var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

        var response = apiClient.Execute(queryOptions);

        if (response.Error != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: {response.Error}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

The API client provides comprehensive error handling. Here are some examples:

### Handling API Errors

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using APIVerve.API.WorldNews;

public class Example
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

        var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

        try
        {
            var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);

            // Check for API-level errors
            if (response.Error != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"API Error: {response.Error}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Status: {response.Status}");
                return;
            }

            // Success - use the data
            Console.WriteLine("Request successful!");
            Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
        }
        catch (ArgumentException ex)
        {
            // Invalid API key or parameters
            Console.WriteLine($"Invalid argument: {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException ex)
        {
            // Network or HTTP errors
            Console.WriteLine($"Network error: {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Other errors
            Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling with Retry Logic

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using APIVerve.API.WorldNews;

public class Example
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

        // Configure retry behavior (max 3 retries)
        apiClient.SetMaxRetries(3);        // Retry up to 3 times (default: 0, max: 3)
        apiClient.SetRetryDelay(2000);     // Wait 2 seconds between retries

        var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

        try
        {
            var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);

            if (response.Error != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"API Error: {response.Error}");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Success!");
                Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Failed after retries: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Custom Headers

Add custom headers to your requests:

```csharp
var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

// Add custom headers
apiClient.AddCustomHeader("X-Custom-Header", "custom-value");
apiClient.AddCustomHeader("X-Request-ID", Guid.NewGuid().ToString());

var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);

// Remove a header
apiClient.RemoveCustomHeader("X-Custom-Header");

// Clear all custom headers
apiClient.ClearCustomHeaders();
```

### Request Logging

Enable logging for debugging:

```csharp
var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]", isDebug: true);

// Or use a custom logger
apiClient.SetLogger(message =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"[LOG] {DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {message}");
});

var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);
```

### Retry Configuration

Customize retry behavior for failed requests:

```csharp
var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]");

// Set retry options
apiClient.SetMaxRetries(3);           // Retry up to 3 times (default: 0, max: 3)
apiClient.SetRetryDelay(1500);        // Wait 1.5 seconds between retries (default: 1000ms)

var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);
```

### Dispose Pattern

The API client implements `IDisposable` for proper resource cleanup:

```csharp
var queryOptions = new WorldNewsQueryOptions {
    Category = "technology"
};

using (var apiClient = new WorldNewsAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]"))
{
    var response = await apiClient.ExecuteAsync(queryOptions);
    Console.WriteLine(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented));
}
// HttpClient is automatically disposed here
```

        "description": "The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine. On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.) As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 10 series has some useful features, including Magic Cue, which proactively aims to surface relevant information when you need it, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.      The best Android phone overall The best budget Android phone The best maximalist phone The best Android phone that isn’t huge The best lightweight big phone The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge The best foldable phone Other Android phones worth considering What’s coming next  If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations.  With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal.  However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone. The best Android phone overall Google Pixel 10 Google’s Pixel 10 has a 6.3-inch OLED display, Google Tensor G5 processor, 12GB of RAM, support for Pixelsnap wireless charging, and a triple-lens camera system that includes a new 5x telephoto.   Score: 8  ProsCons   Qi2 wireless charging with magnets is great AI is actually kind of useful, finally Telephoto camera is a nice addition  Main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the Pro Battery life is just okay    Where to Buy:   $799 $599 at Amazon (128GB)  $799 $599 at Best Buy (128GB)  $799 $599 at Google (128GB)  Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 The Pixel 10 is Google’s latest take on the “just right” Android phone that introduces a few notable upgrades. For $799, you get a sharp 6.3-inch OLED screen, the same Tensor G5 chip found in the pricier Pro version, and Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets, no case required. The device is built to handle the day-to-day without a fuss, and the whole thing feels straightforward instead of flashy. This year, the Pixel 10 also adds a dedicated telephoto lens, a first for the non-Pro. Unfortunately, the main and ultrawide cameras are a step down from last year’s model. If you’re not scrutinizing every pixel or chasing low-light portraits, you’ll probably never notice. For regular photos, the Pixel 10 is great; it produces clean shots, solid performance, and enough versatility for the average user. What really sets the Pixel 10 apart, though, is how easy it is to use. AI features like Magic Cue are useful, proactively providing info without getting in the way. For example, it can surface a restaurant’s address or reservation details from your search history or confirmation email as you finalize plans over text. The phone runs cooler than previous versions and handles heavier workloads well, and it shrugs off dust and water. If you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t overcomplicate things, the Pixel 10 is an easy recommendation. Read our full Pixel 10 review. The best budget Android phone Google Pixel 9A   Score: 8  ProsCons   Robust IP68 rating Seven years of software updates Brighter, bigger screen  Missing a couple of AI features AI is occasionally handy, usually weird    Where to Buy:   $499 $399 at Amazon (128GB)  $499 $399 at Best Buy (128GB)  $499 $399 at Google (128GB)  Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 The budget-friendly Pixel 9A nails the essentials, offering a bright 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, IP68 water and dust resistance, wireless charging, and Google’s fourth-gen Tensor G4 chipset. It’s dependable and polished, with steady performance and a battery that lasts all day, even with the always-on display enabled. Overall, it delivers fantastic value for $499 — especially given it’s set to receive seven years of OS updates — and stands head and shoulders above the other inexpensive options we’ve recently tested. Google’s entry-level handset does make some compromises to hit its lower price point, though. The 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel ultrawide cameras are decent for everyday shots, but low-light performance and portrait mode lag behind the latest Pixel 10 phones (and even older Pixel 9 devices). Meanwhile, it runs a more pared-down version of Google’s on-device AI, so you miss out on some features, including the Screenshots app and Call Notes. The core experience is fantastic, though, and the long support window is among the best you’ll find in this price range. If you want a relatively inexpensive phone that feels just a step below today’s flagships, the 9A is an easy pick. Read our full Pixel 9A review. The best maximalist phone Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra   Score: 8  ProsCons   Excellent screen Improved ultrawide camera Rounded corners are comfier  Expensive Bulky AI is (still) hit or miss    Where to Buy:   $1419.99 $849.99 at Samsung (512GB)  $1659.99 $969.99 at Samsung (1TB)  Screen: 6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy. The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents. All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.

The best Android phone that isn’t huge Samsung Galaxy S25   Score: 8  ProsCons   The last reasonably sized Android phone Seven years of OS upgrades Very good camera  Samsung software is as cluttered as usual AI is still a mixed bag    Where to Buy:   $799.99 $650.12 at Amazon (128GB)  $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (128GB)  $799.99 $699.99 at Samsung (128GB)  Screen: 6.2-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25. That’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS. The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.

The best lightweight big phone Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge   Score: 8  ProsCons   Like a regular phone, but slim Surprisingly lightweight Battery life isn’t as bad as I feared  No telephoto camera Battery life not as strong as a standard phone    Where to Buy:   $1099.99 $799.99 at Best Buy (256GB)  $1099.99 at Samsung (256GB)  $1099.99 $799.99 at Amazon (256GB)  Screen: 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main camera with OIS, 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, 12-megapixel f/2.2 selfie / Battery: 3,900mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 Big phones have a tendency to, well, look and feel big. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, is different. Thanks to its slim, lightweight design, the device provides a welcome reprieve from the countless chunky, heavy alternatives. It’s thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Plus, making it the big phone you can actually slide into your pocket or evening bag without it protruding out. So, what’s the catch? The S25 Edge’s battery life is fine. Not great, not terrible, but somewhere straight down the middle. To be fair, it held up admirably during a particularly strenuous workday, one complete with hours of screen time, mobile hotspotting, and live blogging, making it to bedtime with battery to spare. It also lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, though it does feature the same 200-megapixel main camera found in the S25 Ultra. Even with those compromises, the S25 Edge is a very capable phone that offers similar performance and durability to other devices in the S25 lineup. You’ll just have to be a little more aware of battery life as the day goes on; however, unless you’re frequently streaming video or playing graphics-intensive games throughout the day, the noticeably thinner, lighter design offers a nice change of pace.

The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge OnePlus 15 The OnePlus 15 offers some of the best battery performance you’ll find from any flagship phone stateside. There’s a top-shelf processor too, a combination that more than makes up for a lackluster software experience.    Score: 8  ProsCons   Easily a two-day battery for almost any kind of user Big, sharp screen  OxygenOS is looking a little cluttered these days Silicon-carbon battery may limit device longevity Proprietary super-fast wireless charging feels increasingly irrelevant    Where to Buy:   $899.99 at OnePlus  $899.99 at Amazon  Screen: 6.78-inch 1272p 165Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.8 3.5x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 7,300mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69K The OnePlus 15 takes the “never worry about charging” ethos of its predecessor and cranks it up a notch. Its massive 7,300mAh silicon-carbon battery comfortably delivers two days of real-world use — and that’s with every power-draining feature enabled, including the always-on display. You don’t have to baby it to get the best possible battery life, either. If you do need a quick top-off, the included 80W wired charger and patented USB-C cable can provide you with a full day of battery life in just 20-ish minutes of charging. It’s not available in the US yet, but it is available for preorder, with shipments expected to begin in January 2026. As for other specs, the 15 features a sharp 1.5K, 165Hz display and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 chip, meaning there’s more to the handset than just battery life. That said, there are some tradeoffs given the newer technology. The chemistry of silicon-carbon batteries may degrade faster than that of lithium-ion batteries, though OnePlus claims the battery will retain over 80 percent of its overall health for the first four years. The 15 also lacks built-in Qi2 magnets, unlike the Pixel 10, so you may have to fiddle with the alignment on your wireless charger to get it just right. If absurd battery headroom is what you’re after, though, the 15 offers it in spades. Read our full OnePlus 15 review. The best foldable phone Google Pixel Pro 10 Fold   Score: 8  ProsCons   Full dust resistance! On a foldable! Qi2 support with built-in magnets  Heavy and chunky Cameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’ Pricier than a regular phone    Where to Buy:   $1799 $1499 at Amazon (256GB)  $1799 $1499 at Best Buy (256GB)  $1799 $1499 at Google (256GB)  Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 The Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s brings better durability to a category that’s historically fragile. With an IP68 rating, the it’s the first foldable to offer full dust and water resistance. In real-world use, that means the device can take a tumble at the beach and remain relatively unscathed. Plus, you get the convenience of Qi2 support with built-in magnets for snap-on charging and accessories, including Google’s excellent magnetic ring stand. Performance is smooth, too, and the slightly wider outer display feels more like a standard slab-style phone. Battery life is also solid for a folding phone, lasting a full day with minimal use of the inner screen; however, spending more time multitasking on the larger display means the battery may be in the red by bedtime. While the 10 Pro Fold’s cameras are good, they lag behind Google’s other 10 Pro models. The foldable is also over 40g heavier than Samsung’s lightweight Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you’ve been avoiding foldables because of durability concerns, the 10 Pro Fold’s improved hinge design means exposure to dust and grains of sand doesn’t equal certain doom. Read our full Pixel 10 Pro Fold review. Other Android phones worth considering There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation. The Nothing Phone 3 is billed by the brand as its “first true flagship phone,” with a $799 starting price that competes directly with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25, and Pixel 10. It boasts a 6.67-inch OLED display, a generous 5,150mAh capacity battery, and a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chipset, which is on the lower end of the flagship spectrum. It also looks different from previous Nothing devices. Instead of the iconic light strips on the back that glow and flash, the Nothing 3 features a small dot-matrix LED display that can show pictures and icons. Read our review. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is Samsung’s other new foldable device. Unlike previous Flip series devices, the company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. The larger screen is a joy to use, making it much easier to quickly respond to texts and manage full apps. While the design is a big upgrade, the device still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, raising concerns about how the device will hold up over time. Read our review. The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s most refined flagship yet, and a great showcase for the Android ecosystem. It features a premium design and big hardware upgrades over its predecessor, like a Tensor G5 chip and Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets. It also offers genuinely useful AI features, and the camera’s portrait mode is much improved over its predecessor. However, while the 10 Pro’s battery capacity is a bit larger this time around (4,870mAh versus 4,700mAh), the battery life is just okay. We’re also feeling uneasy about generative AI being inside the camera app. Read our review. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a thin, lightweight foldable that feels like a regular phone when folded shut. It has a spacious inner display that’s great for multitasking and gaming, and its battery can last all day with moderate use. That said, the device has a starting price of $2,000 — $200 more than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold — though we’ve seen it drop as low as $1,599. It also has an IP48 rating, meaning it’s fully water-resistant but not completely immune to tiny specks of dust. Read our review. What’s coming next Samsung recently announced the Z TriFold after teasing it earlier this summer. As of now, the device has a tentative launch planned for the first quarter of 2026 here in the US. The foldable features not one, but two hinges, which open to reveal an inner screen that measures 10 inches diagonally, with a resolution of 2160 x 1584 and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can drop all the way to 1GHz. The 1080p outer display, meanwhile, measures 6.5 inches and features a 21:9 aspect ratio, while the device itself is 12.9mm thick when folded shut. It also has a ceramic-glass, fiber-reinforced polymer back panel that’s designed to resist cracking, along with an IP48 rating, meaning it’s fully water-resistant but not dust-tight. In addition to the OnePlus 15, the brand is gearing up to reveal more info regarding the OnePlus 15R on December 17th. Details are scarce, but we know the device will feature a massive 7,400mAh battery. We’re also expecting it to offer a pared-down experience compared to the 15, including a less powerful processor. Depending on how much it costs — the OnePlus 13R launched at $599.99 — the 15R could give the Pixel 9A some serious competition, especially for those who value battery life above all else. While an official launch is likely still months away, we’re already starting to hear murmurs about Google’s Pixel 10A. The device is expected to look similar to the Pixel 9A, according to leaked CAD renders, and carry over some features from the Pixel 10. That means we could see the entry-level 10A launch with Google’s powerful Tensor G5 processor, offering the same great performance as the brand’s best device. Update, December 16th: Updated pricing / availability, added the OnePlus 15 and Pixel 9A as new picks, and added bullets to the “What’s coming next” section.

        "description": "Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes. I’ve been using ebook readers for nearly a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the PocketBook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone.       The best Kindle The best non-Amazon ebook reader The best cheap ebook reader The best ebook reader for taking notes Other ebook readers we tested What’s coming next  The best Kindle Kindle Paperwhite (2024)   Score: 8  ProsCons   The best-looking screen on any e-reader Slightly larger screen without a noticeably larger device Faster page turns, loading, and a more responsive UI A splash of color (without a color screen)  Upgrades aren’t as significant as the last Paperwhite Lacks stylus support and page turn buttons Signature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnets Signature Edition back panel feels less grippy    Where to Buy:   $159.99 $134.99 at Amazon (ad-supported)  $159.99 $134.99 at Best Buy (ad-supported)  $159.99 $134.99 at Target (ad-supported)  Dimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support  If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production.  That warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader. Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon. There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone except Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes & Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There are ways to convert and transfer file formats so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps. However, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite. Read our Kindle Paperwhite review. The best non-Amazon ebook reader Kobo Libra Colour (32GB, ad-free)    ProsCons   Nice color screen with sharp, 300ppi black-and-white resolution Physical page-turning buttons Built-in stylus support Compatible with Overdrive   Getting books from other stores onto the device can be tough More expensive than the Kindle Paperwhite Lacks the vibrancy of other color e-readers No wireless charging    Where to Buy:   $229.99 $199.99 at Amazon  $229.99 $199.99 at Rakuten Kobo  $229.99 $199.98 at Target  Dimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi  (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support  The Kobo Libra Colour is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use. The color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. However, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on. The color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Until recently, Kobo offered support for the bookmarking app Pocket, which was another big selling point as it let you read saved articles offline. While the app is no longer available, Kobo recently replaced Pocket with Instapaper, which you can download in a free update. However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time. But if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite. Read our Kobo Libra Colour review. The best cheap ebook reader Kindle (2024)    ProsCons   Excellent, high-resolution display Easy to hold with one hand Faster than its predecessor with improved battery life Fun color options  No waterproofing Lacks adjustable color temperature Slightly more expensive than its predecessor    Where to Buy:   $109.99 $89.99 at Amazon (with ads)  $109.99 $89.99 at Best Buy (with ads)  $129.99 $89.99 at Amazon (without ads)  Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support  The base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging.  Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime). The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes & Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110. The best ebook reader for taking notes Kobo Elipsa 2E    ProsCons   Intuitive note-taking features Great e-reader Adjustable warm light Useful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion  Lacks native support for Kindle books 227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competition No note-summarization features    Where to Buy:   $399.99 $349.99 at Walmart  $399.99 $349.99 at Target  $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon  Dimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support  Of all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural. The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes. Finally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. You can step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead. Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading.  That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lacks. Other ebook readers we tested There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable: Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter  Kindle Colorsoft Amazon recently  introduced a more affordable alternative to the $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition above called the Kindle Colorsoft. It’s $30 cheaper and delivers a nearly identical reading experience. As expected, Amazon excluded some features to hit the lower price point. Let’s run through them. There’s no wireless charging, which I can live without. Storage is halved to 16GB, which is enough for me as I primarily read ebooks. But if you’re buying a color e-reader, chances are high that you’ll want excess storage space for graphic novels, and 16GB may not cut it.  The biggest drawback for me, as a bedtime bookworm, is the lack of an auto-adjusting front light that can make nighttime reading much easier (however, its brightness and color temperature can be manually adjusted). At this price, I expect it, especially since Kobo’s $159.99 Clara Color includes one. And, given that the Colorsoft Signature Edition costs just $30 more, complete with a front light that adjusts when the room gets dim, 32GB of storage, and wireless charging, I’d opt for that instead if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem. Unless the standard Colorsoft goes on sale for less, it’s not a great value at its regular price. Kobo Clara Colour If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. It’s also noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point. The company recently announced a white version with a slightly larger 1,900mAh battery compared to the black model’s 1,500mAh (notably, without a price increase), which Kobo says can last over a month on a single charge. Nook Glowlight 4 Plus In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book. Boox Palma 2 Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $315.98 Palma 2 also runs Android 13 so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter  Boox Go 10.3 The $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus. However, in comparison to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and comes with a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look. Boox Go Color 7 Gen II In April, Boox introduced the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for $249.99. This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store. While I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance. Kindle Scribe Colorsoft The $629.99 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first color e-reader that’s also designed for note-taking. I’ve yet to test it, but in Victoria Song’s review, she praised its thin, lightweight design, long battery life, and minimal ghosting effect. However, she thought the 11-inch display feels too large for reading or note-taking, and that the muted E Ink colors limit the appeal for artists who want to draw things beyond basic doodles. It’s also a shame that many of its best annotation features — including in-line writing and the AI-powered summarization and search tools — don’t extend to other document types, such as PDFs. What’s coming next Amazon recently announced new versions of its Kindle Scribe that’s great for taking notes on. The $499.99 monochrome model with a front light is out now, but the cheaper entry-level version without a front light that will sell for $429.99 isn’t available yet. Both offer a thinner design and a larger 11-inch display, along with a new AI-powered search tool that makes it easy to quickly summarize documents. Amazon has also updated the homescreen with a Quick Notes section and redesigned the stylus, making it bigger and rounder, which should lend itself to a more intuitive writing experience. Read our hands-on impressions. Update, December 16th: Adjusted pricing / availability, added new details regarding the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, and removed the Boox Palma 2 Pro.

But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified to IGN that the studio is \"neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI\" and published his own statement on X.

        "pubDate": "2025-12-16T18:32:54Z",
        "description": "If you’re shopping for a book lover, it’s hard to beat a Kindle, especially if your giftee already owns a library of Kindle books. Amazon’s latest sale makes them even easier to recommend: the last-gen Kindle Scribe with 32GB of storage and ads is matching its best price to date starting at $279.99 ($140 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the ad-supported versions of the Kindle (Amazon, Best Buy, and Target), Kindle Paperwhite (Amazon, Best Buy, Target), and Kindle Colorsoft (Amazon, Best Buy, Target) are all near record-low prices, starting at $89.99 ($20 off), $134.99 ($25 off), and $189.99 ($60 off) respectively. If you’re looking to gift a note-taking e-reader, the last-gen Kindle Scribe remains a terrific option, even without the new Scribe Colorsoft’s color E Ink display. It offers a sharp, spacious 10.2-inch, 300ppi display and — unusual for a note-taking e-reader — an adjustable warm light for comfortable nighttime reading. You can jot down notes directly on Kindle books using the included stylus, which conveniently features an eraser and a customizable shortcut button. Plus, the Scribe doubles as a standalone digital notebook, with premade templates and AI-powered tools that can summarize your notes or clean up messy handwriting. Amazon’s other Kindles are also solid gifts, particularly if you prioritize price or portability. While they don’t offer note-taking capabilities like the Scribe, they’re amongst the best e-readers on the market, delivering an excellent reading experience thanks to their sharp 300ppi displays. Each weighs about the same as an iPhone 17 Pro Max, making it easy to slip into a bag; the entry-level Kindle’s small six-inch design is even pocketable. All offer long battery life with convenient USB-C charging, while the Colorsoft stands out by adding a 150ppi color mode that’s especially appealing for fans of graphic novels. And, with the exception of the Kindle, they’re all IPX8-rated for water resistance, so you don’t need to worry about winter storms or spills. Read our reviews of the Kindle Scribe (2024), Kindle Paperwhite (2024), and Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Kindle Scribe (2024) The 2024 Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes.

        "pubDate": "2025-12-16T18:21:07Z",
        "description": "Hisense’s U65QF is currently on sale for around $575 ($302 off), which is just $27 shy of its lowest price to date.\t  Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount. There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Hisense, or Samsung — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day, and the lead-up to the Super Bowl. Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.  The best 4K TV deals for most people The best budget-friendly 4K TV deals The best deals on high-end 4K TVs  The best 4K TV deals for most people Samsung Q8F Samsung’s Q8F is available for around $597.99 ($152 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console. The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $402 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,597.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. Samsung Q8F  Where to Buy:   $747.99 $597.99 at Amazon (55-inch)  $749.99 $599.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)  If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $574.99 ($425 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing. The U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.  As for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for an all-time low of $735.99 ($564 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Hisense U65QF TV (2025)  Where to Buy:   $847.99 $574.99 at Amazon (65-inch)  $998.99 $574.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)  $1299.99 $735.99 at Amazon (75-inch)  TCL Nxtvision TCL’s Nxtvision is an entry-level “art TV,” and both the 65- and 75-inch models are currently on sale at Best Buy for $799.99 ($500 off) and $1,497.99 ($302 off), respectively. The 4K TV set has a matte 120Hz QLED screen with a brightness of around 441 nits, and it can display more than 100,000 pre-generated AI artworks, your own photos, or one of over 300 pieces of art from its built-in library. It features two HDMI 2.1 ports best suited for current-gen game consoles and PC gaming, along with HDMI 2.0 ports, which are fine if you want to hook up a 4K Blu-ray player or previous-gen game system. Verge senior reviewer John Higgins tested the A300W and liked the way the TV looked once its included bezel set was installed, which made the TV look more like an actual painting. He also liked that it uses Google’s TV platform, an operating system he found easy to navigate and use. However, it was noticeably dimmer than the other art TVs he tested, and the artwork quality could vary from piece to piece. Still, the A300W is a great choice if you’ve been curious about getting an art TV but don’t want to immediately make the jump to a higher-end model like Samsung’s Frame Pro. TCL Nxtvision TV (A300W)  Where to Buy:   $1299.99 $799.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)  $1799.99 $1497.99 at Amazon (75-inch)  $1799.99 $1499.99 at Best Buy (75-inch)  The best budget-friendly 4K TV deals Amazon Fire TV 4-Series Amazon’s current-gen Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade from a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 43-inch model is currently on sale at Amazon for $289.99 ($40 off) — its second-best price to date — or you can step up to the 50-inch model for $349.99 ($50 off) or the 55-inch model for $409.99 ($50 off) if you like the TV’s features but want a larger set. Amazon’s newer 4K TV features a 60Hz LED panel, which is perfectly fine for casual gaming or watching TV shows and movies. It supports HDR10 Plus and HLG HDR, so colors on properly mastered video and games will look especially good. The Fire TV 4-Series runs Fire OS and comes with a remote that lets you access Amazon Alexa with the push of a button, allowing you to control your smart home accessories and quickly execute voice commands. The TV also features three HDMI 2.0 ports and one HDMI 2.1 ARC port, which are sufficient for connecting multiple game consoles, a 4K Blu-ray player, a soundbar, and other home theater equipment. Amazon Fire TV 4-Series  Where to Buy:   $329.99 $289.99 at Amazon (43-inch)  $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon (50-inch)  $459.99 $409.99 at Amazon (55-inch)  Hisense QD7 If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for $349.99 ($150 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $448 ($152 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Hisense QD7  Where to Buy:   $499.99 $349.99 at Amazon (55-inch)  $499.99 $349.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)  $599.99 $447.96 at Amazon (65-inch)  The best deals on high-end 4K TVs Sony Bravia 8 II If you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to a new low of $1,998 ($602 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. Sony also says its TV has modes that are specifically calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services. If you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo are all currently offering the 65-inch model for around $2,298 ($1,202 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen. Sony Bravia 8 II  Where to Buy:   $2999.99 $1998 at Amazon (55-inch)  $2999.99 $1998 at B&H Photo (55-inch)  $3499.99 $2298 at Amazon (65-inch)  LG C4 The last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for $1,299.95 ($1,200 off) at B&H Photo. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide. Additionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.95 ($1,700 off) at B&H Photo. LG C4  Where to Buy:   $1596.99 $1296.99 at B&H Photo (65-inch)  $3496.99 $1896.99 at B&H Photo (77-inch)  Samsung S90F If you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $897.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course. The S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,397.99 ($1,102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. Samsung S90F  Where to Buy:   $1199.99 $897.99 at Amazon (42-inch)  $1199.99 $899.99 at Best Buy (42-inch)  $1999.99 $1397.99 at Amazon (65-inch)  Hisense U8QG If you want a premium TV but don’t want an OLED set, Hisense’s U8QG is an excellent alternative that’s currently available at Amazon and Best Buy in its 65-inch configuration for an all-time low of $949.99 ($1,250 off). The TV has a mini-LED panel with full-array local dimming, so blooming shouldn’t be a huge issue. It also features a 165Hz refresh rate and three HDMI 2.1 ports, making it a great choice for those with a gaming PC or a current-gen console like the PlayStation 5. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so gaming PCs outfitted with an AMD card should experience fewer graphical glitches, including screen tearing. Hisense says the U8QG has a maximum screen brightness of 5,000 nits, which is substantially higher than the OLED TVs we’re recommending here. It also supports all your major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus, HLG, and Advanced HDR by Technicolor, so it’ll show vibrant colors regardless of how the video you’re watching — or game you’re playing — was mastered. Its AI processor was also designed to improve the clarity and brightness of SDR content, and the TV’s high refresh rate and peak brightness make up for the fact that its panel offers lower contrast than an OLED TV. That’s an impressive feature set, especially for a TV that retails for under $1,000. Hisense U8QG  Where to Buy:   $2199 $949.99 at Amazon (65-inch)  $2199 $949.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)  Samsung Frame Pro According to The Verge’s own John Higgins, Samsung’s Frame Pro is the best “art TV” you can buy for watching TV shows, and the 65-inch model is matching its all-time low of around $1,597.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. Both Amazon and Best Buy have also knocked the price of the larger 75-inch model to around $1,997.99 ($1,600 off), which has been the promo price since mid-November. Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV features a 120Hz LED panel with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits and better color accuracy (especially in filmmaker mode) than its competitors. Its matte screen reflects less light than a typical LCD or OLED screen, which is helpful whether you’re watching TV shows in a bright room or using the TV’s “Art Mode,” which allows you to display famous paintings. The TV comes with a small selection of free art, but you can gain access to more than 4,000 pieces by subscribing to the Samsung Art Store for $50 a year. The Frame Pro also comes with the wireless Connect Box, which features four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a coaxial input, an ethernet port, and an optical audio input. You plug devices into the wireless Connect Box, which then sends audio and video from your source to the TV. Samsung recommends keeping it within 10 meters of the TV, but the wireless latency (lag) from the setup shouldn’t matter much when watching videos; however, it may be noticeable if you’re playing fast-paced video games, including first-person shooters. Samsung Frame Pro  Where to Buy:   $2199.99 $1597.99 at Amazon (65-inch)  $2199.99 $1599.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)  $3599.99 $1997.99 at Amazon (75-inch)  Update, December 16th: Updated pricing / availability and added deals for Amazon’s Fire TV 4-Series, Samsung’s Frame Pro, the Hisense U8QG, and TCL’s Nxtvision TV.",
