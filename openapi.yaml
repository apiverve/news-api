                    title: Adidas plugs its website and app into Amazon&#8217;s &#8216;Buy with Prime&#8217; program
                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T20:54:47.0000000Z
                    description: Adidas’s site and app will soon get “Buy with Prime” Amazon fulfillment, allowing Prime members to receive free shipping and streamlined returns when ordering directly from the three-stripe brand.  Beginning in the spring, paying US-based Amazon Prime subscribers will see Prime-eligible items for sale on adidas.com and through the Adidas app. By logging into their Amazon account during checkout, those items will be fulfilled by Amazon. In addition to faster free shipping, Prime members who make purchases this way will be able to view and track the purchase through their Amazon account. If you do the bulk of your shopping on Amazon then Buy with Prime may be a handy way to centralize your purchase history into one easy-to-find location, or at least make your subscription fee go a little further on the websites of other brands. While Adidas is joining thousands of other companies registered in the direct-to-consumer Buy with Prime program, it seems to be a notable score for Amazon when it comes to brand clout. Other notable brands linked up with the program include Belkin, Steve Madden, Laura Mercier, Izod, MrBeast, and more.

                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T20:45:35.0000000Z
                    description: 'An American Airlines plane on the tarmac at the Miami International Airport on February 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida. | Photo: Joe Raedle / Getty Images  American Airlines has announced support for Apple’s Share Item Location feature, potentially making it easier for passengers to be reunited with lost luggage tracked with an AirTag. The airline transported 226,405,000 passengers around the world last year, making it the busiest and one of the largest carriers in the US. Share Item Location was first introduced as part of the iOS 18.2 update released last December. AirTag users are able to generate a shareable link within Apple’s Find My app on iPhones, iPads, or Macs allowing others to access an interactive map showing the location, or last known location, of a missing item. The link will be deactivated when a lost item is recovered and the location sharing can be turned off at any time. The links also automatically expire after seven days. “We’ve introduced the ability for customers to easily and securely share the location of their AirTag or Find My network accessory directly with the airline,” an American Airlines spokesperson told View from the Wing’s Gary Leff. “Customers can generate a link through Apple’s Share Item feature available on iOS 18.2 or later and share it with American in the rare case when a bag is delayed for any trips with a segment from or to a U.S. airport. Customers just need to scan the QR code at the baggage office to start their claim and provide their information.” Airlines like United, Delta, and Air Canada integrated the Share Item Location feature into their lost luggage procedures soon after it was released. Additional carriers, including Lufthansa Group and Virgin Atlantic, announced support earlier this month.'

                    title: The Verge’s favorite kitchen gadgets
                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T20:30:00.0000000Z
                    description: 'Many members of The Verge’s staff enjoy cooking — and all enjoy eating. Inspired by that admittedly obvious thought, we asked them to say which kitchen tools they most enjoy using these days. We got a wide and fascinating array of answers. They include gadgets that need to be charged, such as electric kettles, blenders, and smart thermometers, as well as simpler, non-powered tools like egg holders, spreader knives, and wooden spoons. (Sometimes simpler can be better.) So check out how our writers and editors hone their foodie skills, and let us know in the comments what your favorite kitchen tool is. (And feel free to check out our previous listing of favorite kitchen gadgets.) Charged gadgets As new parents, my wife and I heat up water a lot, whether it’s for baby formula or for our third cup of a caffeinated beverage to get us through the afternoon. We used to heat our water in a teapot on the stove — the horror — but after getting an electric kettle over the holidays, our lives have been forever changed. With this, the water heats up way faster, and the kettle turns itself off once the water is too hot, meaning it won’t whistle through the house (and possibly wake the baby). It’s the only kitchen gadget that has a permanent spot on our counters. Maybe I’ll heat up some tea for myself right now. — Jay Peters, news editor After realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter I may take some heat for this, but anyone who tells you that frozen Junior Mints, M&M’s, or — gasp — Sno-Caps are the perfect companion for an at-home movie night is unequivocally wrong. Popcorn is the true film snack, and Presto’s basic air popper has been my go-to in recent years for quickly whipping up large batches of the timeless treat.  The PopLite doesn’t require oil, nor do you need to shake or stir it like you do traditional stovetop methods. You just toss in the kernels, plug it in, and let the hot air do the work for you. Admittedly, it’s a little loud and bigger than I’d like for a single-use appliance that sits in my pantry, but you’d be hard-pressed to find a more foolproof method of making popcorn. Well, unless you’re into prefab bags of Orville Redenbacher. Even I can’t fault you for that. — Brandon Widder, senior commerce editor For the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer How often do you blend things? Is it never? Maybe the reason is that taking out, assembling, and cleaning up after a normal blender is just way too much work. Do you know how many sauces I’ve thickened since getting an immersion blender? This thing is small, quick to set up, and you can mostly clean it with just a blast under the faucet. You’re going to blend so many things. — Jacob Kastrenakes, executive editor My wife and I bought this small blender to make ourselves smoothies and protein shakes. It’s now used to make purees for our baby. C’est la vie. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer A meat thermometer is essential in my kitchen, and I haven’t found one as easy to use as the Typhur InstaProbe. I just flip and probe, and then I have a temperature reading in seconds — there’s no need to press any buttons or fiddle with any settings. I’ve used it for well over a year and haven’t had to change its batteries once; it always just works when I pull it out of the drawer (not the case with other digital alternatives I’ve tried). It’s also waterproof, so it’s easy to clean. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer Simple tools One of the first things I did when I got my own place was purchase a food chopper. Perhaps puritan chefs will disagree with my methods, but this saves me so much time. I like to make tikka masala, which requires dicing ginger. If you’ve ever tried to dice ginger, you know that a food chopper would come in handy. This one did break recently, so I’ll probably replace it with a fancier one. — Kylie Robison, senior AI reporter Spreading knives are fantastic, especially if you make as many sandwiches as I do. The broad, flat blade is perfect for spreading peanut butter, cream cheese, or whatever, and the serrated edge is sharp enough for removing crusts and slicing bagels.  The one I used growing up was a Cutco, a relic of my dad’s brief, unsuccessful stint as a knife salesman. This is not that knife. That knife costs $94 today, which feels like a bit much — even if the one my parents have is still in great shape after 45 years — so I got this Wüsthof instead. The handle isn’t quite as comfortable, but it’s a quarter of the price, so I’ll live.  — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor My partner and I have the unfortunate habit of buying interesting foodstuffs with the intention of eventually using them — and then finding them in the back of the fridge two months later, growing something, well, interesting. To try and track what we’ve refrigerated, we tried all sorts of phone and tablet apps, but in the end, what finally worked was a simple, inexpensive, and thin magnetic whiteboard. It sticks to the door of the refrigerator, along with some dry markers, and now we record what entrees and side dishes are in the fridge. As each is consumed, the entry gets erased. It’s a simple solution, and it’s not perfect. We still occasionally find a scientific experiment blooming in the back of the fridge, but it’s made us a lot less likely to waste food. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor I never realized how much joy I could get from a grater until my partner and I picked up a Microplane last year. Whether I’m zesting lemons or creating big, pillowy clouds of grated parmesan for my pasta, the Microplane is an absolute pleasure to use. We still keep a big, blunt box grater around for the occasional vegetable, but the Microplane’s sharper blades are better for absolutely everything else. It’s not just us, either — we’ve since gifted this twice, to rave reviews. And if you know me in real life, then I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before a Microplane comes your way, too. — Dominic Preston, news editor It’s kind of weird how much I like our Gripstics. Bag of chips open? Quick, grab a Gripstic. Kids vibing between two different cereals this week? A well-placed Gripstic will ensure they don’t get all squishy. Tiny package of chocolate chips you used for a recipe that is now kind of open in your cupboard for who knows how long? Just fold the top over, slide a Gripstic on it — the small blue one, thank you — and stop worrying so much.  I don’t know about you or your family’s shopping and eating habits, but try as we might to shop on the outside walls of the grocery store, we inevitably come home with many products packaged in single-use plastic bags. That in and of itself is a frustration, only compounded by those same products going bad if they’re not stored properly. The Gripstics are a simple solution to this universal problem, and one that I’m certain has paid for itself many times over.  — Christopher Grant, group publisher, The Verge and Polygon Pretty much every meal I cook includes garlic, so I genuinely don’t know why it took me so long to get a simple garlic press. But ever since I threw one in the cart absentmindedly on a recent IKEA run, it’s become one of my most-used kitchen tools. I still have to peel the garlic, which I find interminably annoying, but I haven’t had to slice or mince garlic since adding it to my utensil drawer. The press turns the garlic into a kind of mush, and it’s not consistent in the pieces it makes (sometimes larger slivers of garlic get caught around the edges of the press), but for my needs, which is mostly just tossing garlic into a sauté pan or a soup, it’s a dream. — Kristen Radtke, creative director I love a humble piece of bread and butter, but I hate spreading cold, hard butter on bread. Luckily, I haven’t had to since June 2023, when I finally got an airtight ceramic butter dish to store room temperature butter indefinitely. Am I recommending you do the same? No — I’m not prepared to debate anyone on the science behind keeping butter from spoiling. (The FDA says it can be left at room temperature for only one to two days.) All I will say is that the combination of salted butter, an airtight container, and a pair of kids who help me go through it one well-buttered grilled cheese sandwich at a time, has been more than enough to address my own fears.  There are many options like the small Sweese that I use. It just happened to be the first Amazon pick I didn’t return, because it was the first that fit a single block of Kerrygold almost perfectly. — Sean Hollister, senior editor My mom bought me this strange-looking juicer. I was skeptical at first, but I love how it folds flat so that it doesn’t catch on the shallow drawer that I store my kitchen spatulas in. And, of course, it works well as a juicer and is pretty easy to clean. — Helen Havlak, publisher, The Verge Once you get a set of narrow measuring spoons, you’ll never go back. Rather than having to carefully pour a teaspoon or tablespoon of spice into a round measuring spoon that doesn’t fit through the neck of your spice jar, you can just scoop directly from the jar. I absolutely love mine for recipes that require a lot of different spices. This stainless steel set from King Arthur Baking feels solid and has held up well for me despite frequent trips through the dishwasher over the last five years. — Helen Havlak, publisher, The Verge If you’re a backyard chicken owner (or live in Europe or Asia), this elegant countertop egg holder is an excellent way to display your ladies’ efforts and have easy access to eggs. The Hovico Egg Skelter’s metallic spiral design pushes the oldest eggs to the end so you can use them first. It’s then easy to add the newly laid (or purchased) ones to the top. As a bonus, it doubles as a nice decorative piece for your kitchen counter. (Note: fresh, unwashed eggs do not need to be refrigerated as they have a natural coating.) — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer We have a drawer full of silicon spatulas in our kitchen that I use exclusively for flipping eggs and nothing else. For any other cooking task, I use my beloved wooden spoon. I love that it’s firm but doesn’t scratch ceramic pots and pans, and there is nothing better for deglazing a pan than a wooden spoon, which perfectly scrapes up all the delicious brown bits of a sear after you add a little vinegar or alcohol. While my other spatulas and spoons have broken or the silicone has begun to tear, my wooden spoon is almost indestructible. Bury me with it. — Kristen Radtke, creative director'

                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T19:39:15.0000000Z
                    description: 'Rumours about the next mainline Avatar series have been circulating ever since Nickelodeon announced that Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko were returning to lead Avatar Studios. But now, we finally know a bit more about where the franchise is heading after The Legend of Korra. Today, Nickelodeon announced that the Avatar saga (which began with The Last Airbender) will continue with Avatar: Seven Havens, a new 2D animated series co-created by Konietzko and DiMartino and executive produced by Ethan Spaulding (Mike Tyson Mysteries) and Sehaj Sethi (The Winchesters). No casting or potential release windows have been teased, but the network shared that Seven Havens’ story will be told over the course of 2 seasons consisting of 13-half-hour-long episodes each. Seven Havens will introduce a new earthbending Avatar who is seen as a threat to the world because of her powers. “Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization’s last strongholds collapse,” according to Nickelodeon. The show’s announcement comes just a little under a year after the premieres of Netflix’s live-action The Last Airbender adaptation that Konietzko and DiMartino bowed out of in 2020 after two years of production due to creative differences. The Last Airbender showrunner Albert Kim similarly parted ways with the series after its first season, and Netflix brought on Jabbar Raisani and Christine Boylan to oversee the show’s next chapter. Though Netflix’s Avatar project is its own thing separate from what Avatar Studios is working on, there might be some narrative tissue connecting Seven Havens’ story with Nickelodeon’s upcoming movie focused on Aang and his friends in the time between The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. But that won’t become clear until Nickelodeon decides to share more.'

                    title: Kia unveils PV5 electric van as a futuristic ‘people mover’
                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T19:23:25.0000000Z
                    description: 'Kia revealed the exterior design of the upcoming PV5 electric van, the automaker’s first EV to come out under its “Platform Before Vehicle” (PBV) brand.  With the PV5, Kia has declared its intention to compete with heavy hitters like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, Ford E-Transit, Mercedes eSprinter, and Ram ProMaster EV. There are very few electric vans on the market today, but that looks to be changing with these new entrants. The PV5 will come in a number of configurations, depending on whether you want something for cargo delivery, rideshare, or just to fulfill your #vanlife fantasies. There will also be models built for specialized conversions, which is sure to thrill the van conversion aftermarket. While the passenger version features a large window area, the cargo variant emphasizes space efficiency with a clean, modern look. Kia didn’t offer any details about its powertrain, range, price, or availability. The PV5 will be the first of many PBV-branded vehicles to come from Kia. PBV was introduced during CES 2024 in Las Vegas as a family of EVs built on a flexible vehicle architecture, with different swappable body types. The vehicle can be transformed from a minivan to a full-size van to a small truck, depending on the specific need. The driver cab remains fixed, while the rest of the vehicle is interchangeable, like a real-life Duplo set. At the time, Kia said that the PV5 would be ideal for ridehailing, delivery, and utilities. Uber swooped in soon after to sign a memorandum of understanding to add the PV5 as an option for its drivers in the hopes of fulfilling its pledge to go all-electric in all markets by 2040. Kia said it will reveal more details about the PV5, as well as a new model, at its Kia EV Day in Spain later this month. A heavily camouflaged PV5 was spotted by Electrek earlier this month in the US.'

                    title: DJI’s RS 4 Mini camera stabilizer can now track moving people
                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T19:07:25.0000000Z
                    description: 'The DJI RS 4 Mini works with smaller mirrorless cameras and smartphones using an optional mount. | Image: DJI  DJI has announced a new version of the smallest camera stabilizer in its Ronin series. Like last year’s RS 3 Mini, the upgraded RS 4 Mini is a more compact, lighter, and cheaper alternative to DJI’s RS 4 and RS 4 Pro stabilizers, but designed for smaller mirrorless cameras and smartphones. Although it’s slightly heavier than its predecessor, the RS 4 Mini introduces subject tracking through an optional module, similar to what DJI recently launched with its Osmo Mobile 7 Pro. The DJI RS 4 Mini is now available through the company’s online store in three versions. On its own, the gimbal sells for $369, but the $459 DJI RS 4 Mini Combo adds the new tracking module and a Mini Briefcase Handle accessory. There’s also the $478 DJI RS 4 Mini Creator Combo that includes the same accessories plus a smartphone holder for mobile creators looking to get more creative. It’s a little heavier than its predecessor — 890 grams (a little under two pounds) up from 795 grams — but the RS 4 Mini offers the same capacity with support for cameras weighing up to 4.4 pounds. Battery life gets a boost from 10 hours to 13 now, while a 30-minute fast charge provides five hours of use. Even with the extra weight the RS 4 Mini could be worth the upgrade thanks to DJI’s new RS Intelligent Tracking Module. It features its own camera and DJI’s tracking technology allowing the gimbal to autonomously follow and keep a moving human subject in frame from over 32 feet away without the need for DJI’s Ronin mobile app. Tracking can also be stopped and started remotely using an open palm hand gesture for creators working alone, while a new Responsive mode improves performance when capturing fast moving subjects. Other upgrades include faster switching to vertical shooting mode, a new Teflon coating to further smooth out movements and balancing, and a smaller and lighter horizontal briefcase handle allowing shots to be more easily captured from lower angles.'

                    pubDate: 2025-02-20T19:05:39.0000000Z
                    description: 'Elon Musk bought Twitter, and now he’s rebranding it as X. Signs have gone up (and back down), icons are changing, and an old plan is new. How’d we get here? On April 4th, 2022, we learned that Musk had purchased enough shares of Twitter to become its largest individual shareholder. Eventually, he followed up with an unsolicited offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each, or about $44 billion.  Twitter accepted Musk’s offer, but then things got weird because he tried to cancel the deal. There was a lot of back-and-forth about bots and text messages, but in the end, Musk settled on buying the company rather than facing a deposition or Chancery Court trial and eventually strode into Twitter HQ carrying a sink. Since then, there have been layoffs, more layoffs, and even more layoffs — plus drama over Substack, unpaid bills, and blue checkmarks. With ad revenue still down from previous years, Elon finally abdicated the role of CEO in May 2023, installing longtime NBCUniversal ad executive Linda Yaccarino.

                    description: 'iPhone 16E back view  Apple has announced an update to the iPhone SE, but this time around, it’s called the iPhone 16E. As the rumors predicted, Apple’s new budget iPhone model has an updated design with a Face ID-enabled notch, replacing the old model that had a home button and Touch ID interface. Another new element is that this is the first iPhone with an Apple-designed 5G modem inside, the new C1, which Apple says is “the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone.”       The iPhone 16E has a 6.06-inch OLED display, customizable Action Button, and Apple Intelligence-ready A18 chipset to match the standard iPhone 16, but not a Dynamic Island display, no MagSafe support, and only a single 48MP rear camera lens. It also has a USB-C port instead of Lightning, and unlike the SE, it’s not much smaller than Apple’s flagship iPhones. The iPhone 16E launch is scheduled for February 28th, with preorders starting on February 21st, with two colors (white or black) and three storage capacity options (128GB, 256GB, and 512GB) and a starting price of $599.

                    description: The iPhone 15 Pro will get Visual Intelligence, Apple’s Google Lens-like tool that lets you point your phone’s camera at things in the world to learn more about them, in a future software update, Apple representatives told John Gruber of Daring Fireball. Visual Intelligence was originally introduced with the initial iPhone 16 lineup in September, and Apple showed it off as a feature that you launched from the Camera Control button. But yesterday, Apple announced that Visual Intelligence would be available on the iPhone 16E, which does not have the Camera Control button, through its Action Button. That suggested that the feature could technically work with the iPhone 15 Pro, which also has an Action Button, and now Apple is confirming that Visual Intelligence will indeed come to that phone and be available via the Action Button. You’ll also be able to launch Visual Intelligence from the Control Center on the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple told Gruber. Apple didn’t tell Gruber which update will bring Visual Intelligence to the iPhone 15 Pro, however. He speculates that it could arrive with iOS 18.4, which could launch in developer beta very soon and is expected to be available publicly in early April.
